### React Ecosystem
- **React-router**: Closing in on a decade of client-side routing, React Router v6 takes the best features from previous versions in our smallest and most powerful package yet. (https://reactrouter.com)
- **Redux**: A Predictable State Container for JS Apps. (https://redux.js.org)

### Libraries
-  **Sweet Alert**: A BEAUTIFUL, RESPONSIVE, CUSTOMIZABLE, ACCESSIBLE (WAI-ARIA) REPLACEMENT FOR JAVASCRIPT'S POPUP BOXES. (https://sweetalert2.github.io/)

### Architecture / Conventions
- **BEM**: was invented at Yandex to develop sites which should be launched fast and supported for a long time. It helps to create extendable and reusable interface components. BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach to web development. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast even with a complex UI, and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting. (https://en.bem.info/)
